                For more than twenty years, I have been very passionate about getting involved in
                creative endeavors, such as Theatre and Music, that bring joy to others.
                Collaborating with others to create something exciting and entertaining is extremely
                satisfying. Over the course of my entire life, I have enjoyed finding creative and
                logical solutions to problems. For the past ten years, I have worked in the creative
                field of Game Development as a C# Engineer, Designer, 3D Modeler, 3D Rigging
                Engineer, Mobile Programmer, Rendering Specialist, and Educator with some of the
                best developers and educators around. And finally, In the past couple of years, I
                have found that my passion for bringing joy to others, my creativity, and
                problem-solving skills fit well into the Web Development Industry. I look forward to
                meeting new people and being a part of a new group of developers in the Web
                Development Industry.

                I am a soon-to-be graduate of the Engineering Flex Full Stack Program at Thinkful
                and have learned valuable tools and resources to help me make the transition to Web
                Development. My experience in Game Design and Development provides me with a unique
                perspective on Interactivity and Design principles that encourage engagement and
                increase interest while maintaining an elegant functionality and responsiveness of
                content. Collaborating with other developers in the game industry has been a
                significant influence on my career that has helped to shape me into a very
                collaborative and team-oriented individual that can perform multiple roles in a
                small group or specialize in a specific area on a larger team. My background as an
                Educator makes me a master problem solver and collaborator on fast paced, highly
                technical projects. My knowledge in a wide range of subjects provides me with
                insight into other pieces of the puzzle, which allows me the opportunity to
                anticipate future issues and considerations for the design and/or functionality of a
                project.{" "}
