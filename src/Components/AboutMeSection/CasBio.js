                I’ve always loved to bring joy to others through Theatre and Music. Working with
                others to put something exciting and entertaining out there for people to enjoy is a
                wonderful thing. I’m also a pretty logical person and really enjoy solving puzzles
                in creative, outside-the-box, ways. For over ten years now I have worked in the Game
                Development field as a C# Engineer, Designer, 3D Modeler, 3D Rigging Engineer,
                Mobile Programmer, Rendering Specialist, and Educator on some of the best teams you
                could ask for. In the past couple of years, I have found that my previous
                experiences have led me to pursue a career in Web Development. It really feels like
                a good fit. I am excited to meet new people and be a part of a new group of
                developers in the Web Development Industry.{" "}

                I am stoked about this new chapter in my life. I am a soon-to-be Graduate of the
                Engineering Flex Full Stack Program at Thinkful and have gained additional expertise
                in the valuable skills and tools to hit the ground running. My time in the Game
                Design and Development industry gives me a leg up in incorporating Interactivity and
                Design principles that make people want to come back and visit the site again.
                Working with other developers in the game industry has been a great experience that
                has helped to shape me into a very collaborative and team oriented kind of person
                that can wear multiple hats on a small team or focus on a specific part of the
                process on a larger one. My background as an Educator in such a fast-paced technical
                field makes me a master problem solver and collaborator. I’ve taught a lot of
                subjects from 3D Modeling and Animation to Mobile Programming and AI Concepts.
                Understanding all the pieces of the puzzle gives me the foresight to expect the
                unexpected because I can see beyond the borders of my own work.

                Simply put, I think this field is fun and innovative, and I want to live my life
                doing what I love while having fun doing it.{" "}
